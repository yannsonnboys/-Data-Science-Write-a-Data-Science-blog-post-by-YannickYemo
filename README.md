## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I decide to use the Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

- As a developer, should I go for a work in the Western World (e.g Europe, America, etc.) or go for work in the Eastern World (e.g; China, India, ect.)?
- What is the well pay salary difference between the Western and Eastern World ?
- On which side of the the World (Western World or Eastern World) developer are satisfied with the job occupation ?
- Between Western and Eastern developers, which one search for more job opportunity ?

## File Descriptions
The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://yemo-yannick.medium.com/three-mains-reasons-why-you-as-developer-need-to-work-in-2022-in-the-western-world-c051f55761a1).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data 2020. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at Stack Overflow link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
